Simple Password Manager

Setup Instructions:
To start this script simply run the main.py script in your terminal. The key.key and passwords.txt files will be autogenerated in the same directory as the main.py file.
If you attempt to run the main.py but delete the original key.key file and try to view the passwords, you will run into an invalid token error. This error is caused by 
trying to decrypt the passwords with the wrong token. To fix this simply delete the passwords file and key file and rerun the script.
